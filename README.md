# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Yogesh and I'm a software professional who really like boyscout rule. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. Technology amazes me in the way it brings ease in the life of people.

Certified in multiple tools, technologies and agile processes, I write and share what I am familiar with.
